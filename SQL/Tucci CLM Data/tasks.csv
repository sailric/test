<p>The focus of this unit is to improve your understanding and effectiveness using the most basic operation in behavior analysis, <strong>observation</strong>.</p>
<p>You were introduced to observation activities in an earlier unit.  In this unit, you will make observations and put them into a form that will be useful when teaching.</p>
<p><strong>What is the significance of observation? </strong></p>
<p>The observations that we make in CLM programming are <strong>direct</strong> and <strong>deliberate</strong>.  In order to make observations that will help us when teaching, we carefully <strong>define</strong> the behaviors that we observe.  We also take care to choose the<strong> times and places</strong> that we make our observations.</p>
<p>Our aim is to collect <strong>reliable</strong> data using effective observation.  We can use this data to see whether our teaching procedures are bringing about the kind of changes we want.</p>

<p>To demonstrate mastery,  you will have to determine if learner(s) are participating or not participating, by either watching video segments similar to the ones seen in this unit or by conducting observations of one or several learners in your classroom.</p>
<p>At the end of the unit, when you are ready,  you will schedule a <strong>performance review</strong> with your coach to demonstrate mastery of your observation and data collection skills. </p>

<p>CLM Unit 5 has been divided into two sections.</p>
<p>In the <strong>first</strong> one, you will study how to <strong>record observation</strong> data on specially designed data collection sheets.                                </p>
<p>You will also learn to monitor an individual learner\'s performance in semi-directed conditions. </p>
<p>In the <strong>second</strong> section you will learn to monitor the learners’ performance in teacher-directed conditions. </p>

<p>There are four steps involved in making observations:</p>
<p>1.  Observation begins with a <strong>factual description </strong>of the existing episodes.   You have already had some practice doing this, and you will gain some more practice during this unit.</p>
<p>2.  Select the most accurate <strong>descriptors of  learner and teacher actions</strong>.  In this unit, we are going to be looking at the learner\'s participation and what the teacher does to develop or weaken it. </p>
<p>3.  Use a specially designed data collection sheet. The data collection procedures can be provided by your behavior analyst. </p>

<p>As you may have noticed, this was <strong>not</strong> exactly a semi-directed condition as we had expected.  The learner did not participate consistently.   It was necessary for the teacher to <strong>rearrange</strong> some parts of the condition so the learner could be successful.  She did an EXCELLENT job!</p>
<p>Since the task is not a ‘FIRM Task’, the condition does not meet the requirements per our description of participation in semi-directed conditions.</p>
<p>The teacher had to PROMPT to get the first ‘drop’ to occur and had to do the same to prevent him from dropping a block in too soon.</p>
<p>Therefore, you need to <u>put a hyphen</u> <strong>(-) </strong>in the box you drew in the second cell for this time period.  This mark indicates that the condition had to be <strong>rearranged</strong>, therefore we could not assess participation in a semi-directed condition. </p>

<p class=\""note\""><strong>Note</strong>: Each week’s data begins on Monday and ends on Friday. </p>
<p>The fourth <strong>period</strong>  appeared to be working most days until the last episode you observed, when the teacher rearranged the condition by USING a new material (i.e., interlocking puzzles).</p>
<p><strong>Remember</strong>, one of the <strong>major</strong> benefits to seeing emerging patterns is that it <strong>alerts</strong> us to pay closer attention to the conditions that may not be WORKING!  The sooner we know  something is not working the sooner we can rearrange the parts of the condition so that the learner and the staff person can be successful. </p>
